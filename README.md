# simple-CSharp-calc
a simple C# calculator, also this is the first thing ive ever made in C# btw

## Instructions, ig
First, type the symbol for the operation you wanna preform.
Supported operations are: multiplication (x, or *), addition (+), division(/), and subtraction (-), for now.
Then, type the first number of your equation.
Then, type the second number.
Then it will output the answer.
# Currently, only 2 numbers are supported (eg. 3+2),
Hopefully it will soon support more, but I am also just starting out with C# right now.
I have used Java before, too, and I can make something that adds 2 or more variables and prints the output, in Java, too.
